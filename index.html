            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Cody Coleman. I am an aspiring front end engineer looking to learn as many modern and useful programming languages as I possible can. Although I was originally a physics student at Cal Poly Pomona, I found a love for the logic and flow of computer programming and have since put all of my efforts into my true passion.
                
        
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my passion for my career path, I am a former paid professional competitive gamer and used to be very involved in the marketing scene for competitive games. I still love playing in my spare time as well as spending time with my lovely girlfriend and her funny dog. 

            </p>

            <p>
                My biggest influences in this field are friends of mine who have been working in the field self taught and found what they really love to do. I plan to join them soon.
